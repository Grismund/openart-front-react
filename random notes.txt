check/radio box for search results started. I was struggling with how to run the hangleGetRequest method from two different components,
(the search box and the check box). This article https://upmostly.com/tutorials/adding-multiple-functions-inside-a-single-onclick-event-handler
made a case for just writing separate methods for each component to use within the main class component. It worked! I still have to 
sort out the conditional logic (if the box is checked but no term is inserted...). Big win!
