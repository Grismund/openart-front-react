check/radio box for search results started. I was struggling with how to run the hangleGetRequest method from two different components,
(the search box and the check box). This article https://upmostly.com/tutorials/adding-multiple-functions-inside-a-single-onclick-event-handler
made a case for just writing separate methods for each component to use within the main class component. It worked! I still have to 
sort out the conditional logic (if the box is checked but no term is inserted...). Big win!

Cleaned up logic for checking and searching so they played nicer with one another.

Overview of changes needed

TODO: Front End
x Display more results per search than 10.
    Fixed with &limit=50
- Paginate results (optionlly, I may implement this after I get the back end setup)
    Reacstrap Pagination guide can be found here: https://deploy-preview-2356--reactstrap.netlify.app/components/pagination/#
x Fix the carousel not automatically advancing bug.
    Wasn't a bug. Rather, reactstrap has particular ways of doing things. I plugged in vanilla reactstrap. 
    I hate that I lose the responsive loading of images with srcset. There might be a way to code this in React by looking at the srcset code.
- Remove unused features:
    - Shopping cart button
    - Buy Print button
    - Collections
- Add contact/cross link to other work
- Clean up alignment and spacing

TODO: Back End
- Create and Delete User
- Authentication
- Log in and Log out
- Add / Remove Favorites
- Create a favorites page

work
Got Carousel working with basic reactstrap. Heavy-handed if/else statement for changing caption color though. 
Need to fix my titles/captions. Maybe fix that if/else statement. Look for as substitute for the srcset property.
Got 50 images returned. Can work on pagination based on the link above.

Fixed Carousel non-responsive image sizing by adding className="img-fluid" to each image.
Messed up my node_modules trying to install a media query library for react. Removed node modules and reinstalled it. Works fine.
Tried many things to get a responsive media query based image swap on the carousel. My clunky version would be doing the media query then having 
    two methods to render two different sized carousels based on the device size. However, it seems like there would be a lot of unnecessary code.
    Seems like I should be able to set the item source to a variable, and change that variable's value to a smaller/bigger image file based on the 
    device size. But I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how to pass the state from the query componenet to the functional component for the 
    carousel. Probably props no doubt. I think the HOME component should house the separate carousel component and render it. I can then pass the 
    state down using props for it to be put into the item source as a variable. Work on that soon.
