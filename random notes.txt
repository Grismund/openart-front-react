check/radio box for search results started. I was struggling with how to run the hangleGetRequest method from two different components,
(the search box and the check box). This article https://upmostly.com/tutorials/adding-multiple-functions-inside-a-single-onclick-event-handler
made a case for just writing separate methods for each component to use within the main class component. It worked! I still have to 
sort out the conditional logic (if the box is checked but no term is inserted...). Big win!

Cleaned up logic for checking and searching so they played nicer with one another.
